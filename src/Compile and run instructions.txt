How to compile and run:

- Place all .java class files in a single folder 
- Open the Commmand Prompt/Terminal
- Navigate to the assignment folder (where .java files are)
- Enter javac *.java (to compile)
- Enter java Driver (to run the program)
- This will begin a new game for you. You can start by clicking on any square.
From there, make valid knight moves to cover every square on the board. When
all squares have been selected, a winner is announced. Clicking on the New
Game button will restart your game. (You can click this at any time, the number 
of possible moves are counted at the bottom if you get stuck.)
